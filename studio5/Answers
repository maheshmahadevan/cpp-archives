1)
Vectors do not support front insertion , deque and list support front insertion. All containers support back insertion.

2)
Using push front will inverse the behavior in which data was pushed into container.
./studio5 
Deque print
1 2 3 4 5 
List print
1 2 3 4 5 
Vector list
1 2 3 4 5 

3) List does not support Random Access , Vector and deque supports

Deque print
1 2 3 4 5 
Vector list
1 2 3 4 5 

4) Set only allows insertion to be done once , i.e duplicate entries are not allowed.  Set sorts entries after insertion.
Multiset allows duplicate entries. Multiset also sorts entries after insertion.

5)
values inserted map<int, const char *> are sorted after insertion and are printed out in sorted fashion. Wheras values inserted to map< const char *,int> are printed in same order as they were inserted. Both map are similar to set as they do not allow inserting duplicate values
